## Installation instructions

- Clone this repo and `cd` into it
- Install Postgres ([see here for instructions](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-postgresql))
- Enter Postgres command line tool (`psql postgres` on Mac)
- Create database by typing `CREATE DATABASE exresident_requests;`
- Ask us for the database password
- Add user 'centrepoint' and assign as the owner of the database:  
  `CREATE USER centrepoint WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'password-here';`  
  `ALTER DATABASE exresident_requests OWNER TO centrepoint;`
- Create a `config.env` file with the following two lines:  
  `export DB_URL = postgres://centrepoint:password-here@localhost:5432/exresident_requests`
  `export DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS = 2`   
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- Run `npm run build` to build the database
- Run `npm start` to start the server
- Navigate to `http://localhost:9443/` in your browser

#### In order to set up an HTTPS server
- generate a key file for your certificate  ($ openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048)
- generate an intermediate file (csr)  ($ openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem)
- generate a certificate file, using the key and csr ($ openssl x509 -req -days 9999 -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem)
- remove the intermediate csr file
